<div id="about">
  <p>
    After immigrating from China, we opened our first family owned restaurant in
    Floral Park, New York. We’ve been serving this community for over 15 years,
    and we look forward to continue serving delicious, fresh Chinese takeout.
    Stop by for our lunchspecial for a quick bite, or stay a while and get the
    dinner combination. Eat in, take out, or we can deliver – with us, you
    always have a choice.
